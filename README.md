SVM-HandDetection Project as part of the Machine Learning course, Spring 21, SBU

Built a Classifier by training a SVM model to detect human hands from Images. This distinguishes between the images with hands to non-hands. Improvised the classifier while training using hard negative-mining as the dataset has large set of negative samples.
